        O My brother! When a true seeker determineth to take the step of search
        in the path leading unto the knowledge of the Ancient of Days, he must,
        before all else, cleanse his heart, which is the seat of the revelation
        of the inner mysteries of God, from the obscuring dust of all acquired
        knowledge, and the allusions of the embodiments of satanic fancy. He
        must purge his breast, which is the sanctuary of the abiding love of the
        Beloved, of every defilement, and sanctify his soul from all that
        pertaineth to water and clay, from all shadowy and ephemeral
        attachments. He must so cleanse his heart that no remnant of either love
        or hate may linger therein, lest that love blindly incline him to error,
        or that hate repel him away from the truth. Even as thou dost witness in
        this Day how most of the people, because of such love and hate, are
        bereft of the immortal Face, have strayed far from the Embodiments of
        the Divine mysteries, and, shepherdless, are roaming through the
        wilderness of oblivion and error.
      </P>

      <P>
        That seeker must, at all times, put his trust in God, must renounce the
        peoples of the earth, must detach himself from the world of dust, and
        cleave unto Him Who is the Lord of Lords. He must never seek to exalt
        himself above any one, must wash away from the tablet of his heart every
        trace of pride and vain-glory, must cling unto patience and resignation,
        observe silence and refrain from idle talk. For the tongue is a
        smoldering fire, and excess of speech a deadly poison. Material fire
        consumeth the body, whereas the fire of the tongue devoureth both heart
        and soul. The force of the former lasteth but for a time, whilst the
        effects of the latter endureth a century.
      </P>

      <P>
        That seeker should, also, regard backbiting as grievous error, and keep
        himself aloof from its dominion, inasmuch as backbiting quencheth the
        light of the heart, and extinguisheth the life of the soul. He should be
        content with little, and be freed from all inordinate desire. He should
        treasure the companionship of them that have renounced the world, and
        regard avoidance of boastful and worldly people a precious benefit. At
        the dawn of every day he should commune with God, and, with all his
        soul, persevere in the quest of his Beloved. He should consume every
        wayward thought with the flame of His loving mention, and, with the
        swiftness of lightning, pass by all else save Him. He should succor the
        dispossessed, and never withhold his favor from the destitute. He should
        show kindness to animals, how much more unto his fellow-man, to him who
        is endowed with the power of utterance. He should not hesitate to offer
        up his life for his Beloved, nor allow the censure of the people to turn
        him away from the Truth. He should not wish for others that which he
        doth not wish for himself, nor promise that which he doth not fulfil.
        With all his heart he should avoid fellowship with evil-doers, and pray
        for the remission of their sins. He should forgive the sinful, and never
        despise his low estate, for none knoweth what his own end shall be. How
        often hath a sinner attained, at the hour of death, to the essence of
        faith, and, quaffing the immortal draught, hath taken his flight unto
        the Concourse on high! And how often hath a devout believer, at the hour
        of his soul’s ascension, been so changed as to fall into the nethermost
        fire! Our purpose in revealing these convincing and weighty utterances
        is to impress upon the seeker that he should regard all else beside God
        as transient, and count all things save Him, Who is the Object of all
        adoration, as utter nothingness. These are among the attributes of the
        exalted, and constitute the hall-mark of the spiritually-minded. They
        have already been mentioned in connection with the requirements of the
        wayfarers that tread the path of Positive Knowledge. When the detached
        wayfarer and sincere seeker hath fulfilled these essential conditions,
        then and only then can he be called a true seeker. Whensoever he hath
        fulfilled the conditions implied in the verse: “Whoso maketh efforts for
        Us,” he shall enjoy the blessings conferred by the words: “In Our Ways
        shall We assuredly guide him.” Only when the lamp of search, of earnest
        striving, of longing desire, of passionate devotion, of fervid love, of
        rapture, and ecstasy, is kindled within the seeker’s heart, and the
        breeze of His loving-kindness is wafted upon his soul, will the darkness
        of error be dispelled, the mists of doubts and misgivings be dissipated,
        and the lights of knowledge and certitude envelop his being. At that
        hour will the Mystic Herald, bearing the joyful tidings of the Spirit,
        shine forth from the City of God resplendent as the morn, and, through
        the trumpet-blast of knowledge, will awaken the heart, the soul, and the
        spirit from the slumber of heedlessness. Then will the manifold favors
        and outpouring grace of the holy and everlasting Spirit confer such new
        life upon the seeker that he will find himself endowed with a new eye, a
        new ear, a new heart, and a new mind. He will contemplate the manifest
        signs of the universe, and will penetrate the hidden mysteries of the
        soul. Gazing with the eye of God, he will perceive within every atom a
        door that leadeth him to the stations of absolute certitude. He will
        discover in all things the mysteries of Divine Revelation, and the
        evidences of an everlasting Manifestation. I swear by God! Were he that
        treadeth the path of guidance and seeketh to scale the heights of
        righteousness to attain unto this glorious and exalted station, he would
        inhale, at a distance of a thousand leagues, the fragrance of God, and
        would perceive the resplendent morn of a Divine guidance rising above
        the Day Spring of all things. Each and every thing, however small, would
        be to him a revelation, leading him to his Beloved, the Object of his
        quest. So great shall be the discernment of this seeker that he will
        discriminate between truth and falsehood, even as he doth distinguish
        the sun from shadow. If in the uttermost corners of the East the sweet
        savors of God be wafted, he will assuredly recognize and inhale their
        fragrance, even though he be dwelling in the uttermost ends of the West.
        He will, likewise, clearly distinguish all the signs of God—His wondrous
        utterances, His great works, and mighty deeds—from the doings, the words
        and ways of men, even as the jeweler who knoweth the gem from the stone,
        or the man who distinguisheth the spring from autumn, and heat from
        cold. When the channel of the human soul is cleansed of all worldly and
        impeding attachments, it will unfailingly perceive the breath of the
        Beloved across immeasurable distances, and will, led by its perfume,
        attain and enter the City of Certitude. Therein he will discern the
        wonders of His ancient Wisdom, and will perceive all the hidden
        teachings from the rustling leaves of the Tree that flourisheth in that
        City. With both his inner and outer ear, he will hear from its dust the
        hymns of glory and praise ascending unto the Lord of Lords, and with his
        inner eye will he discover the mysteries of “return” and “revival.”
      </P>

      <P>
        How unspeakably glorious are the signs, the tokens, the revelations, and
        splendors which He, Who is the King of Names and Attributes, hath
        destined for that City! The attainment unto this City quencheth thirst
        without water, and kindleth the love of God without fire. Within every
        blade of grass are enshrined the mysteries of an inscrutable Wisdom, and
        upon every rose-bush a myriad nightingales pour out, in blissful
        rapture, their melody. Its wondrous tulips unfold the mystery of the
        undying Fire in the Burning Bush, and its sweet savors of holiness
        breathe the perfume of the Messianic Spirit. It bestoweth wealth without
        gold, and conferreth immortality without death. In each one of its
        leaves ineffable delights are treasured, and within every chamber
        unnumbered mysteries lie hidden.
      </P>

      <P>
        They that valiantly labor in quest of God, will, when once they have
        renounced all else but Him, be so attached and wedded unto that City,
        that a moment’s separation from it would to them be unthinkable. They
        will hearken unto infallible proofs from the Hyacinth of that assembly,
        and will receive the surest testimonies from the beauty of its Rose, and
        the melody of its Nightingale. Once in about a thousand years shall this
        City be renewed and readorned….
      </P>

      <P>
        That City is none other than the Word of God revealed in every age and
        dispensation. In the days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in the days of
        Jesus, the Gospel; in the days of Muḥammad, the Messenger of God, the
        Qur’án; in this day, the Bayán; and in the Dispensation of Him Whom God
        will make manifest, His own Book—the Book unto which all the Books of
        former Dispensations must needs be referred, the Book that standeth
        amongst them all transcendent and supreme.
